            "correct answer:  The Marine Corps this year banned the Confederate flag, and the Army was moving to do the same until Mr. Esper intervened, saying that he wanted to issue uniform guidance across all services.\n",
            "['The Marine Corps this year banned the Confederate flag, and the Army was moving to do the same until Mr. Esper intervened, saying that he wanted to issue uniform guidance across all services.', 'The Pentagon, without once mentioning the word “Confederate,” announced a policy on Friday that essentially banned displays of the Confederate flag on military installations around the world.', 'But the memo goes after the many American soldiers, Marines and airmen who display Confederate flags and other symbols in their barracks and in parking lots on military installations.', 'The guidance never specifically says that Confederate flags are banned, but they do not fit in any of the approved categories — and any such flags are prohibited.', '“In what universe is it OK to turn an opportunity to ban a racist symbol like the Confederate flag into an opportunity to ban the symbol of diversity?', 'Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last week at a House hearing that the Pentagon needed to take “a hard look” at changing the names of Army bases honoring Confederate officers who had fought against the Union during the Civil War, explicitly laying out a course that diverges from his commander in chief.', 'The ban applies to public and shared spaces; troops and military officials can display Confederate flags in areas deemed private and personal, like lockers and single rooms.', 'Ten Army bases that honor Confederate generals who fought to defend the slaveholding South have been the focus of a growing movement for change.', 'Next week, senators will continue their own bipartisan push to strip military bases of Confederate symbols, advancing an amendment to the annual defense bill spearheaded by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, that would require the Pentagon to eliminate Confederate names, monuments or symbols from military assets in three years.', 'In the hearing, General Milley echoed senior military leaders who also wanted to remove the Confederate symbols and base names.', 'In a carefully worded memo that Defense Department officials said they hoped would avoid igniting another defense of the flag from President Trump, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper issued guidance that listed the types of flags that could be displayed on military installations — in barracks, on cars and on signs.', '“It’s absolutely outrageous that Defense Secretary Mark Esper would ban the Pride flag — the very symbol of inclusion and diversity,” said Jennifer Dane, the interim executive director of the advocacy group Modern Military Association of America.', '“Flags are powerful symbols, particularly in the military community for whom flags embody common mission, common histories, and the special, timeless bond of warriors,” Mr. Esper said in his memo, before quoting former Justice John Paul Stevens that the United States flag “is a symbol of freedom, of equal opportunity, of religious tolerance, and of good will for other peoples who share our aspirations.”', 'Mr. Esper’s memo on Friday did not address the issue of bases named after Confederate generals; one senior military official said this week that the Pentagon would wait until after the November election before further raising the issue.', 'A Defense Department official said that the new directive meant that Black Lives Matter and L.G.B.T.Q. flags would not be allowed, either.', 'As protests ignited, senior Defense Department officials began grappling with the legacy of racism in the military.', 'Mr. Esper added in his memo that “the flags we fly must accord with the military imperatives of good order and discipline, treating all our people with dignity and respect, and rejecting divisive symbols.”', 'Mr. Trump, for his part, has sided with those who want symbols of the Confederacy to remain in place.', 'According to the guidance, appropriate flags include those of American states and territories, military services and other countries that are allies of the United States.', 'Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said this week in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that he would not block the effort to rename the bases despite Mr. Trump’s pledge to veto the broader defense bill if Ms. Warren’s amendment was included.', 'Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the House minority leader, told reporters last month that he was “not opposed” to renaming the bases.', '“Therefore, my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations.', 'That senior military leaders are contorting themselves to such an extent shows the gap that has developed between the White House and the movement for racial justice that has swept across the country since the killing of George Floyd while in police custody in May in Minneapolis.', 'Respect our Military!”', 'The House is expected to press ahead on a similar measure as lawmakers consider their version of the military policy legislation.', '“The United States of America trained and deployed our HEROES on these Hallowed Grounds, and won two World Wars,” Mr. Trump wrote in a string of Twitter posts.', '“There is no place in our armed forces for manifestations or symbols of racism, bias or discrimination,” he said.', 'Top Republican leaders in Congress have indicated they would broadly support such measures.', '“Problem solved — we hope,” one Defense Department official said on Friday, speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to anger Mr. Trump.', 'This decision sends an alarming message to L.G.B.T.Q. service members, their families, and future recruits.”', 'Our history as the Greatest Nation in the World will not be tampered with.']\n",

on the race to create a coronavirus vaccine, new drugs could also help curb the pandemic by making the disease less deadly.', 'Not every trial site is seeing such hurdles.', 'Others have the opposite rationale: They don’t want to go through the hassle of a trial only to receive a placebo.', 'Dr. Lyon, who said enrollment in the trial was going more slowly than he expected, said most people ended up “taking a wait-and-see attitude.”', '“We finally have it all set up to go,” Dr. Purow said.', 'When test results come back, “the majority of the time, patients are even slightly feeling better, or they’re not getting any sicker,” he said.', 'I’ve got an I.C.U. full of patients.’”', '“I guess in my hopes and dreams, we enroll the patients in a week or two, but it’s taking longer than that.”', 'Patients typically get tested at a drive-through site, and then return home, rarely visiting a hospital or clinic unless their condition gets worse.', 'At some hospitals, officials have been able to use existing facilities.', 'They are testing various groups of patients, such as those who are positive but not yet sick enough to be hospitalized, and those who have been exposed to the virus from someone already infected.', 'But some patients are reluctant to participate.', 'So far, he said, he has enrolled just one participant, out of a hoped-for 25.', 'But Holy Cross turned down his first choice, a corner of the emergency department, out of fears that the space would be needed for more severe Covid-19 patients.', 'But in other locations, like Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., finding the right spot has been a struggle.', 'Some sites have resisted bringing a highly infectious person onto their medical campuses, potentially sharing a lobby or elevator with people who do not have the virus.', '“We don’t know if it’s going to be directly beneficial to you; we don’t know if it’s going to be harmful to you.”', 'It was in the emergency department, the first place he had requested.', '“Our phones were ringing, probably off the hook the first two weeks,” she said.', 'The idea of installing an outdoor tent was deemed too complicated, and refurbishing a room in a nearby office building would take precious weeks.', '“So the perception is that all this is another mild thing that they can deal with.”', 'But with turnaround times in some areas lagging for five days or more, keeping within those time frames has proved difficult.', 'she said.', 'As a result, once-ambitious deadlines are slipping.', '“When I break it down pretty simply like that, people are like, ‘Oh, let’s do that,’” he said.', 'We’re not seeing as much as we thought we would.”', '“But now, our numbers are declining a little bit.']\n",
